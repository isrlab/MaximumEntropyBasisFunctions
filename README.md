# MaximumEntropyBasisFunctions
 Julia package for maximum entropy basis functions. See examples in example/ for generating basis functions in 1D and 2D. The code is dimension agnostic.

 The code implements algorithm from the following paper:
 *Local maximum-entropy approximation schemes: A seamless bridge between finite elements and meshfree methods by M. Arroyo and M. Ortiz.*
